We're happy to invite you to hackathon for PHP developers.

The originator of this competition is our developer, [Michał Łukaszewski](https://github.com/mlukaszewski). 

Michał is also the "single point of contact" if you have any questions.

Hackathon is held under the patronage of [PHPers](http://phpers.pl).

Here is main site of [PHPackaton 2014](http://phpers.github.io/phpackaton/) (in Polish) & [event page on FB](https://www.facebook.com/events/486201711511468/).

Are you up to the challenge? :)
